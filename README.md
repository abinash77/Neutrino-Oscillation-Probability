# Neutrino-Oscillation-Probability

Here i have modified the hamiltonian for 3 flavour neutrino case, which code can be found in "src" folder hamitonian3nu.py. This code has been modified according to our desired hamiltonian form.
Also to get the probabilities i have modified the example_3nu_matter.py code which can be found inside "test" folder. Running this code will 
generate the probability data in .txt file, which can be used further for getting the the probability plots. Also for each value of eta we have to change hamiltonian form and then run the example_3nu_mattter.py file which generates the probability data in the form of .txt file.
