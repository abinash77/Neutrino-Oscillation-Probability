# Neutrino-Oscillation-Probability

Here i havce modified the hamiltonian for 3 flavour which code can be found in src forlder hamitonian3nu.py according the needed form.
Also to get the probabilities i have modified the example_3nu_matter.py code which can be found inside test folder. Running this code will 
generate the probabilities in .txt file which can be used further for the probability plots. Also for each value of eta we have to change hamiltonian form and then run the example_3nu_mattter.py file and 
generate the .txt file.
